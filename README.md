# README

This is a fan project to make Nova easier to play digitally. Finished project will include a compendium section outlining the games rules and the various sparks and their powers, as well as a pilot creation section used to create playable characters.

Email me at thchrstphrhll@gmail.com for any questions, concerns or feature requests.

Thanks to Spencer Campbell of Gila RPGs for the wonderul game and the folks over at COMP/CON for inspiring this project.
